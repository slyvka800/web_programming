CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages
My task:
 1. Create & Edit Pages
 2. Validate the forms using HTML attributes
 3. If incorrect data is entered in the inputs â€” inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.
 4. Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.
